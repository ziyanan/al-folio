I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, where I have been awarded the Dean's Graduate Fellowship. I am very fortunate to have the guidance and mentorship of [Dr. Meiyi Ma](https://meiyima.github.io/) as my advisor. 

My primary research interest lies in the design of AI-based systems that seamlessly integrate formal specifications and leverage prior knowledge. By combining these elements, I aim to develop advanced AI solutions that are more robust, reliable, and capable of addressing real-world challenges effectively.

Prior to joining Vanderbilt University, I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from New York University. During my academic journey, I had the invaluable opportunity to intern at [Sunthetics](https://sunthetics.io/) as a Machine Learning software engineer, where I worked under the guidance of Dr. Daniela Blanco. Additionally, I served as a research assistant in the computer vision domain at [AI4CE Lab](https://ai4ce.github.io/) of NYU, under the mentorship of Prof. Chen Feng.
