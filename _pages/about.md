I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University with Dean's Graduate Fellowship.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Meiyi Ma](https://meiyima.github.io/). My research interest is designing AI-based systems that are integrated with formal specifications and prior knowledge. 

Before coming to Vanderbilt, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from New York University. I also interned at [Sunthetics](https://sunthetics.io/) as a Machine Learning software engineer under the guidance of Dr. Daniela Blanco and worked as a computer vision research assistant at [AI4CE Lab](https://ai4ce.github.io/) of NYU under the direction of Prof. Chen Feng.
