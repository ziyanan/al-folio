Hello and thank you for stopping by! My name is Ziyan. Some of my friends call me Annie. 

I am currently a senior Computer Science student at New York University with a concentration of Mathematics and Machine Learning.

I have always been interested in artificial intelligence in general and was part of several applied Machine Learning research projects. Previously, I interned at [Sunthetics](https://sunthetics.io/) as a Machine Learning software engineer under the guidance of Dr. Daniela Blanco and worked as a computer vision research assistant at [AI4CE Lab](https://ai4ce.github.io/) of NYU at the direction of Prof. Chen Feng.

Other than that, I like to read influencer blogs and articles on AI ethics.
